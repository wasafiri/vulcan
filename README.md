- ✅ Basic CRUD operations

- ✅ Admin dashboard (basic implementation)
- ✅ Test data seeding
- ✅ User role management (Admin, Evaluator, Constituent, Vendor, Trainer, **Medical Provider** – though Medical Provider is now effectively hidden from the main user management UI)
- ✅ Role-capabilities system with Stimulus controllers for toggling capabilities
- ⏳ Postmark API integration for sending emails (migrated from ElasticEmail)
- ⏳ Enhanced vendor equipment management (partial)

## Technical Stack

- **Ruby** 3.3
- **Rails** 8.0
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Propshaft Asset Pipeline**
- **Solid Queue** (for background jobs)
- **Postmark** (for email delivery)
